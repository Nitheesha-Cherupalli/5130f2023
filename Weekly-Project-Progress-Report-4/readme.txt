Significant progress was made in the fourth week of backend work for our PulseHR Employee Management System, with an emphasis on strengthening security protocols and improving backend logic. Our focus during this phase has been on improving the efficiency and scalability of the backend codebase. Furthermore, we made a concerted effort to strengthen the security of the system by putting strict measures in place, with a focus on data encryption and secure user authentication methods. In the future, we hope to improve user authentication capabilities, optimize system speed, and carry out extensive testing to guarantee the resilience and dependability of the system. Furthermore, we investigated the use of Spring Boot in our quest for backend excellence, utilizing its potential to optimize system performance and expedite backend activities.
